The csv flatfiles in '''spots''' folder are the same data as those in '''SpotGlobal.csv''' (one level up from this folder)
but I have broken them down per fov.
The file '''SpotGlobal.csv''' came from Matlab and to split it by fov I used the python script '''split_SpltGlobal.py''' (also one level up from this folder)
