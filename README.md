# Probabilistic Cell typing by Insitu Sequencing
###A pipeline to cell type and visualise iss data

## HOW TO
There are three stages involved:
- Preprocessing 
- Cell typing
- Visualisation

The preprocessing stage prepares the data for the cell typing step which, when finished generates the flatfiles to be fed into the viewer
