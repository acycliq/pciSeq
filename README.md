Probabilistic Cell typing by In situ Sequencing
==============================================

A pipeline to cell type and visualise iss data

## HOW TO
There are three stages involved:
- Preprocessing 
- Cell typing
- Visualisation

The preprocessing stage prepares the data for the cell typing step which, when finished generates the flatfiles to be fed into the viewer.

### The preprocessor

### Cell typing

### The viewer 
The viewer is a javascript web application running on the client side. Main technologies used are 
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) on a canvas renderer
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) on a WebGL renderer (due to the sublime [PixiOverlay](https://github.com/manubb/Leaflet.PixiOverlay) class)
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
