# pciSeq: Probabilistic Cell typing by In situ Sequencing
A Python package that implements the cell calling algorithm as described in [[Qian, X., et al. Nature Methods (2020)]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0631-4)

## Installation
```
pip install pciSeq
```
## Demo
You can run a pciSeq demo in google colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/acycliq/pciSeq/blob/master/notebooks/pciSeq.ipynb)
