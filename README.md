Probabilistic Cell typing by Insitu Sequencing
==============================================

A pipeline to cell type and visualise iss data
![](screencast.gif)

## HOW TO
There are three stages involved:
- Preprocessing 
- Cell typing
- Visualisation

## The preprocessor
The preprocessing stage prepares the data for the cell typing step which, when finished generates the flatfiles to be fed into the viewer.

## Cell typing

## The viewer 
The viewer is a web application running on the client side. Main technologies used are 
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) on a canvas renderer
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) on a WebGl renderer (due to the sublime [PixiOverlay](https://github.com/manubb/Leaflet.PixiOverlay) class)
- [D3.js] (https://d3js.org/)
