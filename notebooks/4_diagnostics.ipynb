        "The dashboard should now be running on another tab of your browser. It should show two plots similar to the ones below; They are getting refreshed on every loop as they algorithm tries to converge.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gene efficiency can be thought of as the ratio between the observed and the theoretical gene counts. The default value for example, is 0.2 which means that on average for each gene we expect to have 5 times less counts than those expressed in the single cell data. If I had included a plot of the gene efficiency before the start of the iterations then we should have had a bar chart where all bars have the same length and equal to 0.2. This value however changes based on our prior views coupled with evidence that comes from the data and is crystallised when the algorithm converges. This gradual shift  from the data-agnostic state (where only the prior 0.2 is available) to the optimal one is shown in the left plot of the dashboard. It is easy to see for example that Neurod6 stands out with a gene efficiency close to 1.35. Technically, the plot shows the mean of the approximated (ie variational) posterior distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "In my view, the most useful plot to check whether something has gone horrible wrong is the plot on the right. In each loop, it calculates how many cells have been assigned to each cell class and then plots those cell counts. The class that stands out is the Zero class, we see that about 1030 out of the total 3481 (around 30%) have been classed as Zero class. This is not uncommon, quite often the Zero class is the most populated class (could be more than 30% on some occasions). If something has gone wrong however then the vast majority (around 95%) of the cells will be Zero class. If that happens, then one reason could be that the gene efficiency needs to be adjusted. The user should reflect about the reference data (single cell data) and the experiment and set the inefficiency value to something that relfects the case.\n",
        "\n",
        "To familiarise yourself, the user is encouraged to purposely kick-off *pciSeq.fit()* with a mis-specified value for inefficiency, set for example *'Inefficiency': 100* or even *'Inefficiency': 1000*. You will notice that gene efficiency hardly moves as the algorithms loops and all cells end up under the Zero class. With the demo data, the fit finishes after a few runs, your data however maybe more demanding; Hopefully these diagnostic plots will help you detect problems at the very starting stages and you will not have to wait until the end to realise that some has been mispecified.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are confident that you have set a reasonable value for Inefficiency and despite that you get way too many Zero class cells, then a contributing factor could be the *MisreadDensity*. A higher value, (for example from 1e-5 to 1e-4) will tilt the likelihood towards a view that considers the spots as misreads and that will have a knock-on effect on the cell-to-cellClass assignments which will demonstrate itself by the abundance of Zero class cells in our results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most often however it is the *Inefficiency* that needs tweaking and not the *MisreadDensity*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes:\n",
        " - You can close the diagnostics tab while the algorithm converges, nothing will happen to the main loop, they are handled by different processes.\n",
        " - I am using the terms *Inefficiency* and *gene efficiency* interchangeably, they mean exaclty the same thing (which TBH doesnt look very effcient as a way of writing... Strictly speaking they are the complete opposite!)\n",
        " - As you can notice from the plot, each gene has its own inefficiency. The starting value (0.2 in this case) doesnt have to be spot-on, it is just a guess to help the algorithm not to side-step into the wrong search path.\n",
        " - The *MisreadDensity* is set once and never changes throughout the pciSeq run. It is a hyperparamerer, no inference is done about it. This is in contrast to the *Inefficiency* which is assumed as uknown and a probability distribution is drawn to describe our view about it. As said earlier, the mean of its approximated distribution is shown on the left plot below."
